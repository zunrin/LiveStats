LiveStats is an addon that draws a pretty graph on your screen showing how your stats will evolve and helps you track your dots to have a better idea of when to snapshot!

To enter the config menu, just type /livestats

You'll want to set up which dots and buffs you wanna track, and enter your actual stat values unbuffed.

Feel free to contact me in game Zunrin - Evermoon or on Discord Zunrin#5135.
